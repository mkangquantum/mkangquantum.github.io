title: "Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-07-09-nGQPT
excerpt: "We identify a novel phase transition in the Rabi model subject to damping and dephasing. The non-Gaussianity of the dephasing leads to a cascade of stability boundaries for k-th order bosonic operators."
