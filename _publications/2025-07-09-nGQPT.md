title: "Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-07-09-nGQPT
excerpt: "We identify a novel phase transition in the Rabi model subject to bosonic damping and dephasing, where the latter is non-Gaussian. We show that dephasing is a relevant perturbation, leading to a cascade of stability boundaries for bosonic operators."
