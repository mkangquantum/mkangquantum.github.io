title: "Designing Filter Functions of Frequency-Modulated Pulses for High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates in Ion Chains"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-01-05-Filter
excerpt: "We derive and design filter functions of the laser pulses for two-qubit gates on trapped ions, in order to suppress the effects of time-varying fluctuations of the motional-mode frequencies. This improves the experimentally measured gate fidelity from 99.23(7)% to 99.55(7)% in a five-ion chain."
