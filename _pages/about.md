Iâ€™m a Physics PhD candidate at Duke University, working as a theorist in [Brown Lab](https://brownlab.pratt.duke.edu/). I finished my undergrad in Stanford University. I'm originally from South Korea. 

I am excited about using quantum physics to build quantum systems, and using quantum systems to better understand quantum phenomena in Nature. My research interest is in quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and quantum control.
